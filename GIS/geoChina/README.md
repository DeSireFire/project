# geoChina


This module focuses on geocoding in China, taking advantages of both Baidu and Gaode two major LBS platform. It aims for personal usage.

First, based on my personal experience, Gaode can get better information from poi searching. But the quota is much less than Baidu (more expensive). The official website for  documentation is https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/guide/api/.

Second,  doing the address to gis coordinate taks massively can utilize Baidu platform. The official website for documentation is https://lbsyun.baidu.com/index.php?title=webapi/guide.   

The api key for each platform is saved in the zip file where the password is my birthday.
